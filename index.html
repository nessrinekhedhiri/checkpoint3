<p>This episode of the Hubcast is brought to you by DreamDesigner. We’ve started a HubSpot User Slack group with our friends at DigitalMarketer! 
 We wanted to create a place for HubSpotters to ask questions, stay up to date, and build community together.
 There are channels for each Hub (marketing, sales, and service), plus additional channels for things like troubleshooting, HubSpot updates, 
 hacks and more. If you’d like to join, send an email to Carina (cduffy[AT]impactbnd.com) to get your invitation!</p>

<p>A landing page is no ordinary website terrain.  Like an alien discovering a new planet, a prospect "lands" there  giving you the opportunity to
 make them an offer, gather their information, and "make contact." It's exciting. Yet, despite this excitement, 
 it's easy and quite common to get caught up in the ho-hum of creating one.  You have a new offer, grab your go-to template, 
 clone the same form you use every time... Where's the sense of adventure? Where's the creative exploration that makes your reader actually want to convert? 
 The landing page examples below come from a wide range of industries and feature unique designs guaranteed to get your creative juices flowing and inspire lead generation genius. </p>

<p> We all do it -- selfies, pictures of your kids, pets, your new house, a new car... It's a cycle of constant updates! But is
 this behavior creating unrealistic expectations and a false sense of failure for MarketHers and users in general?</p>

<p> If you can’t communicate effectively with your team or organization, you aren’t going effectively lead them to success. While admittedly communication is often a scapegoat for
 larger organizational issues, it is extremely important. With that in mind, today, we are focusing on it as a catalyst to lead our teams more fruitfully. Have you ever had a boss or 
 leader who solely relied on email, notes, or middlemen to communicate with you? I have -- and it wasn’t fun.</p>

<p> Here are the guidelines to teach you how to write a case study Pick your case study subject with the best-completed work supported by measurable results that show how you solved a client problem.
 Gather as much information as possible across the entire story... Write your case study with a narrative that is memorable. Design the case study so it's visually appealing enough for prospects to read. 
There is a difference between learning how to write a case study and learning how to write a case study that is memorable. That persuades. That sings from the rooftops, “Just look at these results
— you know you want to work with us!” Unfortunately, many of the case studies I’ve read are boring, self-aggrandizing, and uninspiring. That’s because most organizations know they need case studies, 
 but fall terribly short in execution. .</p>

<p>We all know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. In this classic fairy tale, poor little Jack’s mother gets majorly miffed when her son comes home with a hand full of “magic beans” instead of the money 
she hoped for after sending him out to sell their only cow. In her eyes, Jack was taken advantage of and manipulated into an unfair exchange and chances are, she wouldn’t be alone in these feelings. 
(I mean, let’s face it, those beans must’ve had one heck of salesman.) Like in the story, salesmen and marketers often get a misleading rap of being manipulative or tricking people into buying things 
they usually wouldn’t (or shouldn’t.) </p>
